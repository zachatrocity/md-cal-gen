# Markdown Calendar Generator for Obsidian

An intentionally simple Obsidian plugin that generates markdown-based table calendars. This plugin allows you to insert beautifully formatted calendar tables in your notes.

## Features

- Generate month view calendars (e.g., November 2025)
- Generate week view calendars (e.g., week of Nov 3 - Nov 9, 2025)
- Support for mobile and desktop
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Customizable settings

## How to Use

### Month View Calendar

1. Open a note where you want to insert a calendar
2. Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) and search for "Insert month calendar"
3. Enter the month in YYYY-MM format (e.g., 2025-11 for November 2025)
4. Click "Insert Month Calendar"

Example output:

```markdown
## November 2025

| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
|  |  |  |  |  |  | 1 |

```

### Week View Calendar

1. Open a note where you want to insert a calendar
2. Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) and search for "Insert week calendar"
3. Enter any date in the week in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-11-03)
4. Click "Insert Week Calendar"

Example output:

```markdown
## Week of Nov 2 - Nov 8, 2025
